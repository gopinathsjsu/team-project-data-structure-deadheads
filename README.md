# XP Core Values
* Communication - We consider that communication is important in software development because it allows information to be exchanged among team members. Our team met in scrums every Saturday, and we used Project Dashboard to manage the project and monitor our user stories. We established open and effective communication to keep everyone up to date on our responsibilities and timeframes.
* Feedback - We had a meeting after each sprint cycle only to provide comments. We displayed our components to each other and inquired input to the components of others on how they may be improved.
* Simplicity - The team was able to avoid include unneeded components and stick to the project requirements to do just what was really essential, such as keeping the system design as basic as possible to make it easier to maintain, support, and change. This aided in keeping our code clean and organized. We took a similar approach to documenting progress and managing the repository.
